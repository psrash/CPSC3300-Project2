We wrote our program in python and used the Model View Controller design pattern.
We have Model classes that include the Memory, Register, PC, etc. classes. These
classes are the classes that actually store and manipulate the data from the 
instruction set. The view class contains the functions to output the data
to the terminal. The Controller class contains the functions that run the actual
program and handle the flow of the program. We first read in the instrucitons one line at a time and then check what operand it is. based on what operand it is we
process it accordingly, adding data to memory, changing registers, program counter,
etc. After each instruction is read and proccesed, the data is output to the terminal using the view class.
